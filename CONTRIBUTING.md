# Contribution Guidelines

1. Add desktop wallpapers to the `wallpapers` folder.
2. If the image is processed with ImageGoNord, name the image accordingly i.e., `ign_imagename.png`.
3. If the image was downloaded from other sources, link to the image or
credit the artist in the README section.
4. If you wish to add mobile wallpapers, please create a new folder if it does not exist.
5. After adding the wallpaper, run `./preview_maker.sh` to generate wallpaper previews.
```
$ ./preview_maker.sh
```
6. Don't delete existing wallpapers. I am using these for my desktop.

That's all. Make a PR :)
